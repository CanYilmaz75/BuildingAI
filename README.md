# Project Title

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This project leverages Python to analyze and predict stock prices of major tech companies. It combines data fetching, processing, visualization, and machine learning to offer insights into stock market trends and future price movements.



## Background

This solution addresses several challenges in financial markets:

Difficulty in understanding market trends and predicting stock movements.
Need for accessible, automated analysis for individual investors.
Integrating various data sources for comprehensive market analysis.
The motivation for this project stems from the growing interest in stock market investments and the need for more accessible financial analysis tools. This project is significant because it empowers individuals with data-driven insights, crucial in making informed investment decisions.

## How is it used?

Users can execute the script to fetch historical stock data, visualize trends, and predict future prices. It's useful in scenarios like:

Individual investors analyzing market trends.
Financial analysts seeking automated tools for data analysis.
Educational purposes for understanding stock market dynamics.
The project's primary users are individual investors and financial analysts. It takes into account the need for accurate, real-time market data and intuitive visual representations.

Code Example
python
Copy code
import yfinance as yf
from datetime import datetime

# Fetch and plot stock data
```
stock = yf.download('AAPL', start='2020-01-01', end=datetime.now())
stock['Close'].plot(title="Apple Stock Price")
```

## Data sources and AI methods
Data is sourced from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance library. The project employs LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks, a type of recurrent neural network, for predicting stock prices.

## Challenges

This project does not guarantee accurate predictions every time due to the inherent unpredictability of the stock market. Ethical considerations include the risk of misinterpreting predictions as financial advice, which must be addressed through clear disclaimers.

## What next?

Future development could involve:

Integrating more diverse data sources (e.g., social media sentiment).
Improving prediction models with advanced AI techniques.
Developing a user-friendly interface for non-programmers.
To progress, collaboration with data scientists and UI/UX designers would be beneficial.
